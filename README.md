# Car racing with promises

JavaScript Promises is a powerfull tool to avoid callbacks hell and to have more control of your asynchronous tasks.

The goal of this repo is to approach promises in a funny way and make an analogy with a racing car where:

- Each car is going to make just one lap;
- Each car is you can think as an async task that will take some time (lap time) to complete;
- The lap time described in each car data strucutre is the time in seconds the car will take to complete the circuit.


Open your favorite Terminal and run:
```sh
$ node carRacing.js
```
